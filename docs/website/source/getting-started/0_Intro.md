##Introduction
###LineDream - a generative art library

LineDream is a generative art library for Python. It is heavily influenced by P5 and Processing. However, it takes a more object-oriented pythonic approach. Each primitive has its own transformation methods and styling properties.

Currently, LineDream targets SVG outputs due to its extensive API for 2D vector graphic. The library was originally created to make art for a pen plotters, however the inner object structure could be applied to other rendering platforms and use cases.
